How to use:
1. Simulate the server first. Go to simulated_Server folder, use terminal to run server.py first (python server.py).
2. To login in or register, go to Client folder, use terminal to run client.py (python client.py).
3. Each instance of terminal means one user using. To simulate a few people chatting together, just start multiple instances of terminal runing client.py with different acount.
